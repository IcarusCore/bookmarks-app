            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 1, 2025</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Bookmarks, a self-hosted application available for download via Docker Hub. This Privacy Policy explains how the Bookmarks application handles data, your responsibilities as a user, and the role of third-party services. As the developer of this application, we do not host, control, or have access to your data. You are responsible for hosting and managing your own instance of the application on your server.</p>
            <p>By using the Bookmarks application, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>Self-Hosted Nature of the Application</h3>
            <p>Bookmarks is a self-hosted application, meaning you download and run it on your own server or infrastructure (e.g., via Docker on Unraid, a local machine, or a cloud provider). As the developer, we do not host this application for you, nor do we have access to, collect, or store any data you input into the application. All data entered into Bookmarks—such as usernames, email addresses, bookmarks, and uploaded images—is stored on your server and managed by you or your server administrator.</p>

            <h3>Data You Provide</h3>
            <p>The Bookmarks application allows you to create an account and store bookmarks, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your username</li>
                <li>Your email address (if provided)</li>
                <li>Bookmark names, URLs, and associated images</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is stored locally on your server in the application’s database and file system. We, as the developers, do not have access to this data, and it is your responsibility to secure and manage it.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>We do not directly integrate with any other third-party services that collect user data. However, if you configure your instance to use additional third-party services (e.g., email servers for notifications), those services may collect data according to their own privacy policies.</p>

            <h3>Our Role as Developers</h3>
            <p>As the developers of Bookmarks, we provide the software for you to download and use. We do not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Host the application for you</li>
                <li>Collect, store, or process any personal data you enter into the application</li>
                <li>Have access to your server, database, or files</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are not responsible for any data breaches, misuse, or legal compliance issues that may arise from your use of the application. You are solely responsible for securing your instance and ensuring compliance with applicable laws (see User Responsibilities below).</p>

            <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>As a user of the Bookmarks application, you are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hosting and Security:</strong> Securing your server to protect the data stored by the application, including implementing HTTPS, strong passwords, and regular updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Backups:</strong> Maintaining backups of your data (e.g., database, uploaded images) to prevent data loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensuring your use of the application complies with applicable data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), or other local regulations. This may include providing your own privacy policy to your users if you allow others to use your instance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p>The Bookmarks application includes basic security features, such as password hashing and user authentication. However, the overall security of your data depends on how you configure and secure your server. We strongly recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit</li>
                <li>Regularly updating the application and your server software</li>
                <li>Restricting access to your server with firewalls and strong authentication</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are not liable for any security breaches or data loss resulting from misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in your server environment.</p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>Since all data is stored on your own server, you have full control over your information. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> View your account information in the Profile section of the application.</li>
                <li><strong>Update:</strong> Modify your username, email, or other details in the Profile section.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete your account or specific bookmarks directly in the application. To delete all data, you can also stop the Docker container and remove the associated database and files from your server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you allow other users to access your instance (e.g., as an admin), you are responsible for managing their data and ensuring their rights are respected under applicable laws.</p>

            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the application or legal requirements. The updated policy will be included in the application’s source code and available on this page within your instance. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will be revised accordingly. Your continued use of the application after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
